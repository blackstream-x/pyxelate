# Pixelate images

The [pixelate_image.py](../pixelate_image.py) script provides a GUI
to partially pixelate the selected image.

## Usage

Call **pixelate_image.py** either from the command line or via
context menu from your file manager
(see [file manager integration](./file-manager-integration.md)).

Thee GUI looks like this:

![Making of this projectâ€™s logo](./making_of_the_logo.png)

In the left panel, the image is loaded, and an indicator is displayed.
You can drag around the indicator with the mouse or create a new selection
by starting a mouse drag anywhere else in the image.
On the right panel, you have controls to fine-fune selection shape,
size and position.
