Select a start frame.\n2. Select the area where the pixelation will start in the selected start frame.\n3. Select an end frame.\n4. Select the area where the pixelation will end in the selected end frame.\n5. Preview the partially pixelated video (flip book style)\n6. Save the video and/or create another pixelation in the same video.\n\nDrag the selection around, resize it or create a new one.\n"
