# File manager integration

The <../autoselect.py> script can be integrated with some file managers
to call pixelation scrips using a click into the context menu of a selected
file.

## Nautilus (GNOME)

Install Nautilus script integration:

```
autoselect.py --install-nautilus-script
```

This will install <../autoselect.py> as a Nautilus script (located in the
contect menu under `Scripts`).

If you provide a name after `--install-nautilus-script`, the script will be
installed with that name, otherwise as `Pixelate`.
