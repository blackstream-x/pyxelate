  "pixelate_image.py": |
    This is a script for pixelating partial areas of images.

    Drag the selection around, resize it or create a new one.

    Fine-tune selection size and position using the controls
    in the “Selection” section of the right hand panel.
    Click the “✓ Apply” button to apply the pixelation at the indicated
    position, or “⎌ Undo” to undo the last applied pixelation.

Original file:
  The first line: shows the name of the current image file
  The button: allows loading another image file

Display:
  Size: shows the scaling factor of the loaded image

Selection:
  Selection: |
    Drag the selection around, or create a new one by dragging
    outside of the selection indicator.
    Fine-tune selection size and position using the controls
    described below.
    When clicking the “✓ Apply” button, the selected image portion
    will be pixelated.
  Tile size: |
    Change the size of the blurred tiles in intervals of 5 pixels.
    Minimum is 10 pixels, maximum 200 pixels.
  Shape: Choose from elliptic or rectangular shapes.
  Width and Height: |
    Fine-tune selection width and height here.
    For “quadratic” shapes (i.e. square and circle), the height will
    follow the width. Minimum is 20 pixels in each dimension.
  "Center at x/y": Fine-tune the selection center here.
  Preview: |
    Show or suppress the preview of the not-yet-applied pixelation.
    This might be useful if you are not sure whether you already applied
    the pixelation at the current position or not.

  Change these colours for better contrast with the image:
  Current: Colour of the current indicator
  New: Colour of the “rubberband” shown when dragging a new selection
