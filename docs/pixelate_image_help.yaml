    This is a script for pixelating partial areas of images.
    Simply drag the selection around, or create a new one by dragging
    outside of the selection indicator.
    Fine-tune selection position and size using the controls
    in the “Selection” section of the right panel.
    Click the “✓Apply” button to apply the pixelation at the indicated
    position.
