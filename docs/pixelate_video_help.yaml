  "pixelate_video.py": |
    This is a script for pixelating partial areas of a number of frames in a
    (short) video clip.
    When loading a video, it will be split up into frames in a temporary directory.

    The workflow in this script is\:
    1. Select a start frame.
    2. Select the area where the pixelation will start in the selected start frame.
    3. Select an end frame.
    4. Select the area where the pixelation will end in the selected end frame.
    5. Preview the partially pixelated video (flip book style)
    6. Save the video and/or create another pixelation in the same video.

    Drag the selection around, resize it or create a new one.

Original file:
  The first line: shows the name of the current video file
  Choose another file: |
    When you click this button, you can load another video file.

Current frame: &frameinfo
  Number: The number of the (currently) displayed frame
  Zoom factor: Shows the zoom factor of the loaded frame
  Crop video: |
    If selected, the video will be cropped when exporting.
    The darkened frame will be cut off.

Pixelation start frame:
  <<: *frameinfo
  Number: The number of the current pixelation start frame

Pixelation stop frame:
  <<: *frameinfo
  Number: The number of the current pixelation stop frame

Select first video frame:
  <<: *frameinfo
  Number: |
    The number of the currently selected first video frame.
    When you leave this panel, all frames preceding the selected one
    will be cut from the video.

Select last video frame:
  <<: *frameinfo
  Number: |
    The number of the currently selected last video frame.
    If this number has been changed, all frames after the selected one
    will be cut from the video when you leave this panel.

Export settings:
  CRF: |
    Constant Rate Factor for ffmpeg (0-51).
    Higher values produce smaller files at the cost of lower quality.
    According to the documentation (https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/H.264),
    a value between 17 and 28 is recommended.
    Default is 18, producing nearly visually lossless output.
  Preset: |
    FFmpeg preset. Slower presets provide better compression.
    According to the documentation (https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/H.264),
    the slowest preset you have patience for is recommended.
    Default is 'ultrafast'.
  Include original audio: |
    If selected, the audio stream from the original video
    will be included in the exported video.

Selection:
  Selection: |
    Drag the selection around, or create a new one by dragging
    outside of the selection indicator.
    Fine-tune selection size and position using the controls
    described below.
    When clicking the “▷ Next” Button, the current selection
    will be set as start (or end) of the pixelation.
  Tile size: |
    Change the size of the blurred tiles in intervals of 5 pixels.
    Minimum is 10 pixels, maximum 200 pixels.
  Shape: Choose from elliptic or rectangular shapes.
  Width and Height: |
    Fine-tune selection width and height here.
    For “quadratic” shapes (i.e. square and circle), the height will
    follow the width. Minimum is 20 pixels in each dimension.
  "Center at x/y": Fine-tune the selection center here.

Show preview:
  "Preview …": |
    In the panels where you select an area to be pixelated, this checkbox will
    show or suppress the preview of the not-yet-applied pixelation.
    Switching off the preview will result in a quicker response
    when you resize the selection using the muse wheel.
    If this box is checked when you click the "Save" button,
    a preview panel will be shown instead of the save dialog.

first_frame: |
  In this panel, you can move the slider or use the controls in the sidebar
  to change the first frame of the desired resulting video.
  If the frame number is greater than 1, all frames preceding it
  will be cut from the video when you leave this panel.

last_frame: |
  In this panel, you can move the slider or use the controls in the sidebar
  to change the last frame of the desired resulting video.
  If the frame has been changed, all frames after it
  will be cut from the video when you leave this panel.
  To avoid confusion by the slider jumping from the video start
  to the video end, it just stays at the start position,
  and if it is left unchanged, no frames will be cut from the end.


Colours:
