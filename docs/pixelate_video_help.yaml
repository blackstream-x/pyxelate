    This is a script for pixelating partial areas of a number of frames in a
    (short) video clip.
    When loading a video, it will be split up into frames in a temporary directory.

    The workflow in this script is\:
    1. Select a start frame.
    2. Select the area where the pixelation will start in the selected start frame.
    3. Select an end frame.
    4. Select the area where the pixelation will end in the selected end frame.
    5. Preview the partially pixelated video (flip book style)
    6. Save the video and/or create another pixelation in the same video.

    Drag the selection around, resize it or create a new one.

Original file:
  The first line: shows the name of the current video file
  Choose another file: |
    When you click this button, you can load another video file.

Current frame:
  Number: The number of the currently displayed frame
  Zoom factor: Shows the zoom factor of the loaded frame
  Crop video: |
    If selected, the video will be cropped when exporting.
    The darkened frame will be cut off.

End frame:
  Number: The number of the current pixelation end frame
  Zoom factor: Shows the zoom factor of the loaded frame
  Crop video: |
    If selected, the video will be cropped when exporting.
    The darkened frame will be cut off.

Start frame:
  Number: The number of the current pixelation start frame
  Zoom factor: Shows the zoom factor of the loaded frame
  Crop video: |
    If selected, the video will be cropped when exporting.
    The darkened frame will be cut off.

More pixelations:
  Add another pixelation: |
    When you click this button, the wizard goes back to the
    first panel (Select pixelation start frame) so you can
    add another pixelation in addition to the one that has
    just been applied.

Export settings:
  CRF: |
    Constant Rate Factor for ffmpeg (0-51).
    Higher values produce smaller files at the cost of lower quality.
    According to the documentation (https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/H.264),
    a value between 17 and 28 is recommended.
    Default is 18, producing nearly visually lossless output.
  Preset: |
    FFmpeg preset. Slower presets provide better compression.
    According to the documentation (https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/Encode/H.264),
    the slowest preset you have patience for is recommended.
    Default is 'slow'.
  Include original audio: |
    If selected, the audio stream from the original video
    will be included in the exported video.

Selection:
  Selection: |
    Drag the selection around, or create a new one by dragging
    outside of the selection indicator.
    Fine-tune selection size and position using the controls
    described below.
    When clicking the “▷ Next” Button, the current selection
    will be set as start (or end) of the pixelation.
  Tile size: |
    Change the size of the blurred tiles in intervals of 5 pixels.
    Minimum is 10 pixels, maximum 200 pixels.
  Shape: Choose from elliptic or rectangular shapes.
  Width and Height: |
    Fine-tune selection width and height here.
    For “quadratic” shapes (i.e. square and circle), the height will
    follow the width. Minimum is 20 pixels in each dimension.
  "Center at x/y": Fine-tune the selection center here.
  Show preview: |
    Show or suppress the preview of the not-yet-applied pixelation.

Colours:
  Change these colours for better contrast with the image:
  Indicator outline: Colour of the current indicator
  Rubberband: Colour of the “rubberband”
