# pyxelate

GUI scripts to partially pixelate images or short video clips

## Requirements

- Python 3 (<https://www.python.org/>)
- Python modules:
  - Pillow (<https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/>), including the tkimage submodule.
    In Debian, you require the packages `python3-pil` and `python3-pil.imagetk`.
  - Tkinter (usually part of the Python distribution).
    In Debian, you require the package `python3-tk`.
- FFmpeg (<http://ffmpeg.org/>) for editing videos

## Usage

The easiest way to use the scripts in this module is to set up
[file manager integration](docs/file-manager-integration.md) and
start the pixelation GUI from your file managerâ€™s context menu.

Alternatively, you can start the **autoselect.py** script with
the image or video file to pixelate as a command line parameter:

`autoselect.py example.jpg`

This will start **pixelate_image.py** for image files
or the not yet implemented **pixelate_video.py** for video files.

See [pixelate images](docs/pixelate-images.md)
and [pixelate videos](docs/pixelate-videos.md)
for detailed descriptions.
